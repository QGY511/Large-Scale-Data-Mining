# Large Scale Data Mining Project

This repository contains projects related to large scale data mining. Our four main sub-projects include Classification, Data Clustering, Recommender System, Regression Analysis, and Twitter Data Analysis. 

## Description

1. **Classification**: This project focuses on applying various machine learning classification algorithms to predict the class of certain data points.

2. **Data Clustering**: The aim of this project is to group similar items in our dataset using unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithms.

3. **Recommender System**: In this project, we build a system to suggest products to customers based on their past preferences.
   
4. **Regression Analysis**: This project involves predicting a continuous outcome variable (Y) from one or multiple predictor variables (X).

5. **Twitter Data Analysis**: The goal here is to analyze the sentiment of tweets on certain topics using natural language processing and other data analysis techniques.
